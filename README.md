- 👋 Hello! I’m Keegan Borig, a junior studying computer engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.
- 👀 I’m interested in using AI/ML/DL for space-related applications and/or financial models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer architecture & organization, embedded systems design, applied discrete mathematics, and basic statistics.
      I'm currently researching automatic knowledge extraction for space situational awareness at the Center for Space, High-Performance, and Resilient Computing (SHREC).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might spark both of our interests.
